## Original User Request:
App Context:
You are an expert product designer and developer building an emotionally intelligent app for couples. The goal of this app is to help people send thoughtful, heartfelt, or even playful apology messages to their girlfriend.

The app has two user roles:

Sender: the one who creates and sends the apology

Receiver: the girlfriend who receives and reads the apology

The sender can either manually write a message or eventually use AI to generate a personalized apology.

For now, this is a web-based application designed with couples in mind, focusing on a warm, romantic, and emotionally intelligent user experience.

Later, it will evolve into a mobile app for iOS and Android.

The overall goal is to reduce friction in emotional communication, make it easier to express sincere apologies, and help couples reconnect through meaningful gestures.

Example use cases:

A boyfriend who forgot an anniversary can quickly craft a heartfelt AI-generated apology

A couple arguing over something small can smooth things over with a playful, emoji-filled message

The design should feel intimate, sincere, fun, and user-friendly, like a mix of Between, Notion, and Duolingoâ€™s friendliness.
